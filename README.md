# 2018 JBCA Work Experience Projects
*Public repository for A-Level work experience projects in January 2018*

This repository contains two separate student projects, designed for around 4 hours of self-led work per project. Both of the Jupyter Notebooks are coded in Python and offer an easy introduction to NumPy and MatPlotLib. Although coding skills are useful, we've designed the projects to be used by people with no previous experience of Python. Each of the Jupyter Notebooks contains a single project with introductory material to get you started and code demos. We've put the more complicated functions into separate python scripts to avoid clutter.

Either of these repositories may be launched in binder
